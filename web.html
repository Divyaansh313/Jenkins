</h1>Welcome to my Website<h1>

	This is my Home page. You will find some technical blogs in here.
	Technology is moving so fast so we have to be rapid and agile with our methodologies.
	Devops is used to make things faster and automated.
	DevOps has six stages:
	1. Code 2. Build 3. Testing 4. Deliver 5. Monitor 6. Feedback
	and DevOps is the key to do that.
